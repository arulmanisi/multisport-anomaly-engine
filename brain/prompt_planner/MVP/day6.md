You are my coding agent.  
We are working on an MVP cricket prediction engine.  
Generate the feature extraction module design in Python (no actual data).  

Requirements:  
1. Define the features needed for cricket match prediction.  
2. Organize them into these buckets:  
   - Match context features  
   - Team-level features  
   - Player-level features  
   - Venue/weather features  
3. Create a clean class structure for FeatureExtractor.  
4. Show input/output schema for the feature extraction step.  
5. Include placeholder functions for:  
   - get_team_strength()  
   - get_player_form()  
   - compute_recent_performance_index()  
   - compute_venue_advantage()  
6. No implementation details; only structure, docstrings, and clear TODO comments.  
7. Everything should be modular so that later we can extend it to other sports.  
8. Make sure the output matches a real-world production ML pipeline.
