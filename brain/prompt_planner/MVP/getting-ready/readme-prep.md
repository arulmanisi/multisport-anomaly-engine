You are my coding agent.

Goal:
Add a "Quick Start" section to README.md so a new user can run the full MVP end-to-end.

Requirements:
1. In README.md, add a section near the top called "Quick Start".
2. Include clear, minimal steps:
   - How to install dependencies (e.g., python version + `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
   - How to generate synthetic data:
       `python scripts/generate_synthetic_ups_data.py`
   - How to train the UPS model:
       `python scripts/train_ups_model.py`
   - How to run the end-to-end demo:
       `python scripts/run_end_to_end_demo.py`
3. Use fenced code blocks for commands.
4. Keep the wording concise and professional.
5. Do not remove or heavily modify existing sections.
6. Show me the updated README.md after editing.
