Rules for Codex

Always read the existing project files before writing new ones.

Do not break existing tests; update tests when behavior changes.

Use Python type hints everywhere.

Keep code modular—no large functions.

Update docs when adding features.

Propose improvements if something in the codebase is unclear or inconsistent.
